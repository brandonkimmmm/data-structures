1. A pro of linked lists is that they allow a program to store each element in any available memory slot. This allows the lists to easily grow to immense sizes. A con of linked lists is that they require a program to search for its elements one by one.

2. A game where one person needs to find something hidden using clues. One clue leads to another clue and the prize is eventually found.

Programming Questions

1.
  LinkedList.prototype.push = function(element) {
    SET node = {
     value: element,
     next: null
    }

    IF the head node does not exist
     THEN SET head to node
    ELSE
     SET current.next to node
    }
  }

  'SET current node to head' is not needed.

2.
  LinkedList.prototype.removeDuplicates = function() {
    SET currentNode to head
    WHILE currentNode exists
      SET checkNode to currentNode.next
      WHILE checkNode exists
        IF currentNode.value is equal to checkNode.value
          SET tempNext equal to checkNode.next
          REMOVE checkNode
          SET currentNode.next to tempNext
          SET checkNode to tempNext
        END IF
        SET checkNode to checkNode.next
      END WHILE
      SET currentNode to currentNode.next
    END WHILE
  }

3.
  LinkedList.prototype.reverseList = function() {
    SET nodeValues to empty array
    SET reversedValues to empty array
    SET currentNode to head
    WHILE currentNode exists
      CALL nodeValues.push currentNode.value
      SET currentNode to currentNode.next
    END WHILE
    SET currentNode to head
    WHILE currentNode exists
      CALL nodeValues.pop RETURNING value
      SET currentNode.value to RETURNED value
      SET currentNode to currentNode.next
    END WHILE
  }
